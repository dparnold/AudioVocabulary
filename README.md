# AudioVocabulary

## Motivation
It takes a lot of effort and time to learn a new language.
And in our busy lifes we have so much to do that there is only so little time to study vocabulary.
BUT there are commutes, the nightly hours in which we clean our apartment or do our laundry.
During this time, we cannot focus on our phone.
BUT we cann listen to audio files, that teach us vocabulary.
The problem with common audio CDs for vocabulary learning is that the user cannot exclude the words he or she has already memorized and has to listen to them over and over again... even in the same order.

Audiovocabulary has one goal:
Enable the user to study vocabulary as effective as possible during the many hours when it is not possible to fully focus.

## System

- The user loads a so-called packege, which contains the vocabulary and the audio files. These are put to a SQL database.
- In the main activity is a play button which starts the playback of the n most relevant vocables.
- The user can set many options, such as the number of words that are repeatedly played, the pauses between the word in the user's native language and the new word, when a word is cosidered memorized, at what intervalls this should be checked ...
- If
